    <h1>Dear Shivee,</h1>
    <div class="letter-content">
      <p>Happy birthday!!! :) I hope you're reading this at 12 AM on 27th of February 2025, and I really hope I got this website to get uploaded to an actual domain otherwise I'll be very disappointed. Hahahahaha, you're finally as old as me and now you don't get to call me old anymore ;). Today is your day and I really really hope you have the best of days from this year and that you remember it as a really good memory atleast until your next birthday rolls in. I'm going to video call you today, if I haven't already and we're going to sit and speak for as long as we can, laugh, argue, hurt our stomachs and so much more. I wish I could be there with you offline today to celebrate your day with you and enjoy and make the most of it, but since I can't I hope this comes close to making you as happy as I would've . Also I really really hope you liked the flowers. Eat lots of good food, take lots of amazing pictures, spend time with the ones you love and enjoy your day today, it's your day after all. If i haven't made myself clear from the other webpage, you can have just another preview of why I love you so so so so much - you're genuinely the most amazing, kind, wholesome, fascinating, joyous and beautiful person I've met in my life and I genuinely see you as someone who completes me. I couldn't have ever asked for anyone better to be by my side all the time and I honestly wouldn't ever choose anyone else either. You're just the most perfect lil human bean there is and I love it. Thank you for everything that you've done for me, from the smallest of getting a glass of water for me to being the person who I am willing to spend the rest of my life with. You have helped me and made so much more of a difference in my life than you realize and I will be forever grateful for that and for you. I hope you realize you're always going to be the one for me and you're always going to be my girl and the reason to my smile. Happy Birthday again Dimples:)</p>
